# Minecraft Java Modding Test
A simple Minecraft mod that I made in my free time to test my Java modding skills!

# Feel free to use this mod for whatever you want!
Credit would be appreciated, though.

# If the mod is not working for you...
Try renaming "MCJavaModdingTest-master" to "Java Programming Test (Minecraft Mod)" as the .project file contains that name.

# Also, one more thing:
Please ignore the .DS_Store files, I have absolutely no idea what they are.
