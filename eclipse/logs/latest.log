[17:36:54] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] Game Oriented Assembly Lisp is a programming language, a dialect of the Lisp language, specifically designed for video games for PlayStation 2, 3, and PSP. It is developed by Andy Gavin and the Jak and Daxter team at the company Naughty Dog. GOAL's syntax resembles the Lisp dialect Scheme, though with many object-oriented programming features such as classes, inheritance, and virtual functions.
[17:36:54] [Client thread/INFO]: [CHAT] GOAL does not run in an interpreter, but instead is compiled directly into PlayStation 2 machine code to execute. It offers limited facilities for garbage collection, relying extensively on runtime support. It offers dynamic memory allocation primitives designed to make it well-suited to running in constant memory on a video game console. GOAL has extensive support for inlined assembly language using a special 'rlet' form, allowing programs to freely mix assembly and higher-level constructs within one function.
